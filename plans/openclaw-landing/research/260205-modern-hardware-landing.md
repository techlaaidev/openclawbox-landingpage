## Animation Guidelines

### Performance Rules
- Use `transform` and `opacity` only for animations
- Keep animations under 300ms for responsiveness
- Use `will-change` sparingly
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Avoid layout shifts during animations

### Animation Purposes
- **Reveal**: Fade in + slight upward movement
- **Emphasis**: Scale up slightly (1.05x) on hover
- **Direction**: Slide in from direction of user's reading flow
- **Delight**: Subtle bounce on CTA buttons
- **Feedback**: Immediate visual response to user actions

## Mobile Considerations

- **Touch targets**: Minimum 44x44px
- **Thumb-friendly navigation**: Bottom-positioned key actions
- **Simplified layouts**: Vertical stacking, no complex grids
- **Performance**: Aggressive lazy loading, optimized images
- **Gestures**: Swipe galleries, pinch-to-zoom on product images

## Conversion Optimization

1. **Clear value proposition**: Within first 3 seconds of landing
2. **Reduce friction**: Minimal steps to primary action
3. **Social proof**: Early in the page flow
4. **Urgency/Scarcity**: Tasteful limited-time offers
5. **Multiple CTAs**: At natural decision points throughout page
6. **Exit intent**: Capture before user leaves
